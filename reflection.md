Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
For this assignment I spoke with Andrea Martinez. I did not consult a second classmate for this assignment. I think I could have benefitted greatly from a second set of eyes, but poor time-management.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I did not attend office/TA hours. I was unable to this week, but plan to for future assignments, as I can see where not going limited my resources available for this specific assignment.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
There are certain syntaxes (?) that I prefer in Java over Python. However, I struggle with confusing certain Python conventions with Java. I think with a slower paced class and more step by step instruction, as well as my utilization of office hours and interaction with classmates can benefit me greatly as I progress through the course.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think in a lot of ways, creating classes in Java is similar to creating functions in Python. When trying to think of what to write in Java, I find it helpful to go through the procedural programming process in Python, and make possible functions that could be converted to classes/objects. I think the concept of OOP is interesting as a whole because of the ability to think through these projects procedurally, and how we might be able to use programming techniques in other areas of our academics.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would 100% advise future students to start assignments early. Even when you feel you have enough time, you probably don't! I would also recommend taking advantage of office hours instead of just relying on online source materials to push through the difficult parts of the code.
